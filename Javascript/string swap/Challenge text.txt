you are given two strings s1 and s2 of equal length,

Return true if its possible to make both strings equal
by performing at most one string swap on exactly one of the strings. 
Otherwise return false.

A string swap is an operation where you choose two indices
in a string(not necessarily  different)
and swap the characters at these indices.

note:
string swap is not accessible in JavaScript.
but is not needed to solve this task
